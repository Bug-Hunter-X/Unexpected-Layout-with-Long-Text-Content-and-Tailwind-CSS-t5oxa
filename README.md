# Unexpected Layout with Long Text Content and Tailwind CSS Classes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS.  Long text content within a div styled with Tailwind classes can lead to unexpected layout behavior, potentially causing overflow and disrupting the intended design.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when a paragraph or other text element contains significantly more text than initially anticipated.  The text might overflow its container, causing elements below it to shift or overlap. This is not a typical case of needing to add explicit width or height settings.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` (or the equivalent file in your project).
3. Observe the layout in your browser.  The long text in the paragraph element might cause unexpected visual issues.

## Solution

The solution involves using Tailwind's `prose` class, which applies sensible defaults for text layout, or using other Tailwind utilities to fine-tune the layout for long-text situations.  See `bugSolution.js` for a demonstration.

## Additional Notes

This bug highlights the importance of comprehensive testing when using Tailwind CSS, particularly for cases involving dynamic or potentially long text content.  Always review your layout thoroughly, even in seemingly simple scenarios.
